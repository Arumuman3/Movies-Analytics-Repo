## miniSit

A mini situation.

# Task

The goal of this project was to perform an analysis to show the relationship between each genre trend and the anomaly of the highest revenue Hollywood movies over the years representing it in a Tableau visualization.

# Action

I created a Tableau dashboard to show the relationship between the genre and revenue generated over the years from 1916 to 2016.

With the data set in hand, i processed the data and created a Tableau bar chat. The processes below:
- Cleaned up the genre, revenue, release date column
- Calculated the sum of the total revenue for each genre
- Designed a horizontal bar chat in Tableau
- Critically studied the chat to develop helpful insights

# Result

Through the project, i learned how to create a bar chat in Tableau and how to clean data in Python using the pandas and numpy library.

# Insights

On completion of the project, i discovered:
- Comedy is the most watched as it generated the highest revenue of 16 billion
- Drama is second in line as it generated a total revenue more than 12 billion 
- Action comes third place as it generated a revenue of about 3 billion
- Music was the least as it's total revenue was less than a billion
